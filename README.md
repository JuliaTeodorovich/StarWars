## Project launch

Follow these steps to run the project on your local computer.

### Preliminary requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following programs installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - for executing JavaScript code.
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - for automating tasks.

### Setting dependencies

1. Open a command prompt (terminal) and navigate to the project folder:

```sh
   cd/path/to/project
```

2. Install all necessary dependencies using npm:

```sh
   npm install
```

#### Launch

1.  Start the project using Gulp:

```sh
npm start
```

This will create a build folder to compile files.
Then use:

- ctrl^C - Y

Then enter in terminal:

```sh
  npm run watch
```

This will start a Gulp task that will monitor changes to the files and reload the project if necessary.

2.  Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:8080

Your project is now running locally and ready to use.
